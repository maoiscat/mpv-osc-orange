# mpv-osc-orange

This is a mpv osc script using my oscf tool.

## Usage

1. Make a new folder in ''\~\~/scripts''. Let's take ''\~\~/scripts/orange'' for example.

2. Download all lua files and put them into that folder.

3. Remove/Disable other osc scripts.

4. Launch mpv and check if it works.

## Other stuff

1. More details about oscf can be found [here](https://github.com/maoiscat/mpv-osc-framework/)

2. You may encounter dark bars on both sides of the video. This is because neither I nor the mpv find a way to adjust the window on the fly.

3. The maximize button in the title bar is actually ''toggle fullscreen''
